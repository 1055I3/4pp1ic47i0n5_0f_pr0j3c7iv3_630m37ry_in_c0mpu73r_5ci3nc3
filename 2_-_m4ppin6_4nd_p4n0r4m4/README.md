Implement naive alignment algorithm, DLT algorithm, and modified DLT algorithm with normalization.
Test what happens when coordinates are altered and compare width DLT algorithm with more than 4 correspondances.

Write a function that receives two photographs and makes a panorama.
Use SIFT algorithm for keypoint detection, and RANSAC algorithm to select the best matching keypoints.
Take 2 original photographs and test the function.
