## 3D reconstruction

Make 3D reconstruction using characteristic points of objects from two photographs.
3D coordinates should be calculated for the invisible points as well.
Test examples and photographs are in the [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cit0klmAiZEYT6i6uAXE0p9KcTGPMt9B?usp=sharing).
