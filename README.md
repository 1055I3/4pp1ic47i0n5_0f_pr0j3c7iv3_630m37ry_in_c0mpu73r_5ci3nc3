# Applications of Prijective Geometry in Computer Science

A collection of homeworks for subject "Applications of projective geometry in computer science" at Mathematical Faculty - University of Belgrade.

I used *Matlab 23.2.0.2365128 (R2023b)* with a number of add-ons such as *Computer Vision Toolbox*.
